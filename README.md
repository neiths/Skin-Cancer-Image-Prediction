# Melanoma Cancer Detection Project
This project aims to develop a melanoma cancer detection system using deep learning techniques. The dataset comprises images categorized into two classes: benign and malignant. Various models, including InceptionV3, ResNet, UNet, and VGG16, are utilized for training and predicting the images.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of images representing skin lesions, labeled as benign or malignant. It is crucial to ensure a balanced distribution of samples across both classes for effective model training.

## Models Used
- InceptionV3: A deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its efficiency in image classification tasks.
- ResNet: Residual Neural Network, which allows the training of very deep neural networks without suffering from the vanishing gradient problem.
- UNet: A convolutional neural network architecture primarily used for biomedical image segmentation tasks.
- VGG16: Visual Geometry Group network, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image recognition tasks.

## Conclusion
The melanoma cancer detection project utilizes deep learning models to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer. By leveraging a diverse dataset and advanced neural network architectures, the aim is to build a robust and accurate system for identifying malignant lesions, thereby aiding medical professionals in making informed decisions regarding patient care and treatment.
